[Kiu](https://github.com/BjoernPetersen/Kiu) Reloaded: Android App for [JMusicBot](https://github.com/BjoernPetersen/JMusicBot)

[Sign up for testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/me.iberger.enq)

### Active Development paused
Currently I'll only be taking care of easily fixed or very critial bugs which make would render the app useless. The current focus is on overhauling and properly testing the [core client library](https://github.com/IIIuminator/Jmusicbot-client)
